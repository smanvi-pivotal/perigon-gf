      "description": "The Business Data Lake – an Evolution in Data Infrastructure\n\nGuest Speaker: Steve Jones, Strategy Director – Big Data & Analytics, CapGemini \n\nRSVP: http://bit.ly/1equKPW\n\nData is growing 60% YoY and there are new data types associated with that growth. The already expensive Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) process is being overburden for extracting, transforming and loading all data. IT departments are looking to maintain or lower costs as data grows by archiving and offloading data processing (which accounts for 60% to 70%) from the expensive enterprise data warehouse.\n\nBig Data technologies, such as Hadoop have already significantly altered the cost dynamics to store all, new and multiple data types like semi-structured and unstructured data. More than 75% of Hadoop uses cases center around data transformation and for archival purposes.  \n\nJoin us to learn how CapGemini and Pivotal are focused on how to take Hadoop to the next level of business transformation through IT transformation. The Business Data Lake promises to increase the amount of data being captured and stored through Hadoop, and more importantly increase the amount of data being analyzed and operationalized within in the business – turning insight into action.",
